### Laravel Ready-Made Applications

#### What it is:
Laravel ready-made applications are pre-built Laravel projects or boilerplates tailored for specific use-cases or types of projects. They're designed to fast-track development by providing a foundational structure, basic functionalities, and common features so developers can avoid starting from scratch.

#### How it works:
1. **Boilerplates & Starter Kits**: Many of these applications come with foundational features like authentication, administration panels, and basic CRUD operations, depending on the app's purpose.
2. **Packages & Dependencies**: They often come bundled with popular Laravel packages or extensions.
3. **Customization**: While they provide a starting point, developers can customize, extend, or remove features according to their project's needs.

#### Why it's like that:
Developing applications often involves repetitive tasks and building common functionalities. Ready-made applications aim to reduce redundancy, save development time, and offer best-practice implementations of specific features.

#### When to use it:
1. **Prototyping**: Quick proof-of-concept without spending time on initial setup and basic functionalities.
2. **Learning**: Beginners can study the code to understand how a full-fledged Laravel application works.
3. **Building Common Applications**: When the goal is a common application type, like blogs, forums, or e-commerce platforms.

#### Pros:
1. **Rapid Development**: Accelerates the development process by skipping basic setup and common functionalities.
2. **Best Practices**: Many ready-made applications follow industry best practices, ensuring the app's robustness and maintainability.
3. **Integration of Popular Packages**: Saves time by having pre-configured and integrated essential packages.
4. **Consistent Structure**: Provides a consistent codebase, making it easier for teams to collaborate.

#### Cons:
1. **Overhead**: Might include unnecessary features or packages that your project doesn't need, leading to bloat.
2. **Learning Curve**: If you're unfamiliar with the packages or the structure used, there might be a learning curve to understand the application.
3. **Customization Limitations**: Making large structural changes might be challenging if the boilerplate doesn't suit the project's needs from the outset.
4. **Updates & Maintenance**: Depending on the community's activity, the ready-made application might not receive updates or could be abandoned.

#### Example:

**Laravel Jetstream**:
- Laravel Jetstream is a ready-made application scaffolding for Laravel. It provides a robust starting point for Laravel applications by bundling features like login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management.
- **How to Use**:
  ```bash
  laravel new project-name --jet
  ```

This command creates a new Laravel application with Jetstream scaffolding. Developers can then run the application and have immediate access to robust authentication and user management features, which can be further customized as needed.

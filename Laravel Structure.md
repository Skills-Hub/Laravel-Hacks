### Laravel Structure

#### What it is:
Laravel's structure refers to the default directory and file organization provided when creating a new Laravel project. This structure aims to provide a logical and standardized way to organize different parts of a Laravel application.

#### How it works:
The primary directories and files in a Laravel structure are:

1. **`/app`**: Houses the core application logic.
   - **`/Console`**: Contains Artisan commands.
   - **`/Exceptions`**: Where custom exception handlers are located.
   - **`/Http`**: Contains controllers, middleware, form requests, and other HTTP-related files.
   - **`/Providers`**: Service providers which are used for bootstrapping and configuring various parts of Laravel.

2. **`/bootstrap`**: Contains scripts that bootstrap the framework.

3. **`/config`**: Where configuration files are stored.

4. **`/database`**: Contains database migrations, seeds, and factories.

5. **`/public`**: The public directory of your application. It houses the front-end assets and the `index.php` entry point.

6. **`/resources`**: Stores views, raw assets (like LESS, SASS), and language files.

7. **`/routes`**: Holds all route definitions.

8. **`/storage`**: Contains compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, caches, and other files generated by the framework.

9. **`/tests`**: Where PHPUnit tests are kept.

10. **`/vendor`**: Contains Composer dependencies.

#### Why it's like that:
Laravel's structure is designed to be clear and organized. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, emphasizing a separation of concerns. Each directory and file has a specific purpose, making it easier to find and manage various parts of an application.

#### When to use it:
For most applications, using Laravel's default structure is recommended. It provides a solid foundation for both small and larger projects. However, as projects grow or have specific requirements, developers might choose to extend or adjust the default structure.

#### Pros:
1. **Clear Organization**: Each component has a designated place.
2. **Scalability**: Suitable for both small and large projects.
3. **Consistency**: Provides a standard, making it easier for teams to work on a project.
4. **Convention Over Configuration**: By having a default structure, it reduces the number of decisions developers need to make about organization.

#### Cons:
1. **Learning Curve**: Newcomers to Laravel might need some time to understand the purpose and location of each directory.
2. **Rigidity**: While flexible, the default structure might not be ideal for every unique project need.

#### Example:
Consider you're developing an online bookstore:

- **Controllers**: You'd possibly have a `BooksController` in `app/Http/Controllers` to handle CRUD operations for books.
  
- **Views**: Your templates for displaying, adding, or editing books might reside in `resources/views/books`.
  
- **Routes**: Your web routes could be in `routes/web.php`, with routes like `Route::get('/books', 'BooksController@index');`.
  
- **Database Migrations**: To define the structure of a `books` table, you'd have a migration file in `database/migrations`.

This is a simplistic example. As you integrate more features like user accounts, reviews, or payments, you'd further leverage the Laravel structure.

### Laravel Application Structure

#### What it is:
Laravel's application structure refers to the default directory and file arrangement provided when you create a new Laravel project. This structure helps developers to organize their application's various components systematically.

#### How it works:
The main components in a Laravel application structure are:

1. **`/app`**: This is where the core application logic resides.
   - **`/Console`**: Contains artisan commands.
   - **`/Exceptions`**: Houses custom exception handlers.
   - **`/Http`**: Contains controllers, middleware, form requests, and other HTTP-related files.
   - **`/Providers`**: Service providers for bootstrapping and configuring Laravel.

2. **`/bootstrap`**: Contains scripts that bootstrap the framework.

3. **`/config`**: Configuration files.

4. **`/database`**: Database migrations, seeds, and test factories.

5. **`/public`**: The public-facing part of your application, such as the front-end assets, `index.php` (entry point), etc.

6. **`/resources`**: Views, raw assets (LESS, SASS), and language files.

7. **`/routes`**: All route definitions.

8. **`/storage`**: Compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, caches, and other files generated by the framework.

9. **`/tests`**: PHPUnit tests.

10. **`/vendor`**: Composer dependencies.

#### Why it's like that:
The structure of Laravel is designed to be intuitive, scalable, and organized. By separating different components into their respective directories, developers can easily navigate and maintain code. It also follows the "separation of concerns" principle, ensuring each component only handles specific tasks.

#### When to use it:
The default structure is ideal for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale applications. However, as projects grow or have specialized needs, developers might choose to customize or extend the default structure.

#### Pros:
1. **Intuitive**: The structure is easy to understand for new developers.
2. **Scalable**: Suitable for small to large applications.
3. **Organized**: Helps in maintaining a clean codebase.
4. **Convention Over Configuration**: Developers don't need to make decisions about the basic organization; it follows good practices by default.

#### Cons:
1. **Rigidity**: Some developers might find the default structure too rigid for unconventional projects.
2. **Learning Curve**: For those new to MVC frameworks or Laravel, understanding the purpose of every directory might take time.

#### Example:
Imagine you're building a simple blog. Here's a basic overview of where different components might reside:

- **Controllers**: You would have a `PostController` inside `app/Http/Controllers` which would handle operations related to blog posts.
  
- **Views**: Your blog post templates would be in `resources/views/posts`.
  
- **Routes**: Web routes would be in `routes/web.php`, where you would define routes like `Route::get('/posts', 'PostController@index');`.
  
- **Database Migrations**: To create a posts table, you would have a migration file in `database/migrations`.

This is a basic example, but as you add features like authentication, API endpoints, or event handling, you'd leverage more of the Laravel application structure.

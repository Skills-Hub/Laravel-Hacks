## Laravel Architecture

Laravel is an open-source PHP web framework designed to make developing web applications easier and faster. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model is responsible for managing the data of the application, the view is responsible for displaying the data to the user, and the controller is responsible for handling user input and updating the model.

### Laravel Installation

#### What it is:
Laravel installation refers to the process of setting up a new Laravel project on a development machine. This involves fetching the Laravel framework's core files, default configurations, and directory structures, allowing developers to start building a web application using the Laravel framework.

#### How it works:
There are a few methods to install Laravel, but the most common one uses Composer, PHP's dependency manager. Composer facilitates fetching the latest version of Laravel and its dependencies.

1. **Via Laravel Installer**: Laravel provides an installer as a global Composer package which can be used to create new Laravel projects.
2. **Via Composer Create-Project**: Developers can also use Composer's `create-project` command to install Laravel.

#### Why it's like that:
Laravel utilizes Composer for its installation to leverage the power of a standardized PHP dependency management system. This ensures that developers can easily fetch the latest stable version, ensure all necessary dependencies are installed, and maintain consistency across different development environments.

#### When to use it:
1. **Starting a New Project**: When you're about to begin development on a new web application using Laravel.
2. **Learning**: If you're just starting to learn Laravel and want to set up a fresh installation for practice.
3. **Upgrading**: If you're moving to a newer version, sometimes it's easier to start with a fresh install and migrate over.

#### Pros:
1. **Simplicity**: With just a single command, you can have a fully configured Laravel application ready for development.
2. **Consistency**: The installation process ensures that every new Laravel project starts with the same directory structure and default configurations.
3. **Rapid Development**: Quickly set up the environment and begin development without manual configurations.
4. **Integration with Composer**: Leveraging Composer ensures that all necessary PHP dependencies are properly managed.

#### Cons:
1. **Requires Composer**: While Composer is powerful, some beginners might find it an additional tool to learn.
2. **Server Requirements**: Laravel has certain server requirements (like specific PHP extensions) which need to be met. This might be challenging in restricted or shared hosting environments.

#### Example:
Here's a step-by-step example of installing Laravel:

1. **Using Laravel Installer**:

   First, you would install the Laravel Installer as a global Composer package:
   ```bash
   composer global require laravel/installer
   ```

   Once the installer is set up, you can create a new Laravel project with:
   ```bash
   laravel new project-name
   ```

2. **Using Composer Create-Project**:

   Without the Laravel Installer, you can directly use Composer to create a new Laravel project:
   ```bash
   composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project-name
   ```

3. **Server Setup**:
   
   After installation, you can navigate to the project directory and start Laravel's built-in development server:
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   php artisan serve
   ```

   By default, this will make the application accessible at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

Remember, after installation, you might also want to configure environment variables, set up database configurations, and other settings in the `.env` file and `config` directory to tailor the application to your specific needs.
